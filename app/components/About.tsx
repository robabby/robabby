        I have 15 years of experience building performant, user-centered web applications across B2B and B2C domains. 
        I specialize in React frameworks and excel at translating complex technical requirements into scalable UI systems. 
        I bring deep experience with design systems, component architecture, and cross-functional collaboration—
        and I’m seeking frontend roles where thoughtful code meets innovation.
